  * Advanced Persistent Threat: An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a network attack in which an unauthorized person gains access to     a network and stays there undetected for a long period of time. The intention of an APT attack is to steal data rather than to cause     damage to the network or organization.
  * backdoor: a feature or defect of a computer system that allows surreptitious unauthorized access to data.
  * botnet: a network of private computers infected with malicious software and controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge,         e.g.to send spam.
  * brute force: Brute force (also known as brute force cracking) is a trial and error method used by application programs to decode         encrypted data such as passwords or Data Encryption Standard (DES) keys, through exhaustive effort (using brute force) rather than       employing intellectual strategies. 
  * exploit: a software tool designed to take advantage of a flaw in a computer system, typically for malicious purposes such as             installing malware. 
  * key logger: A keylogger is a type of surveillance software (considered to be either software or spyware) that has the capability to     record every keystroke you make to a log file, usually encrypted. A keylogger recorder can record instant messages, e-mail, and any     information you type at any time using your keyboard.
  * logic bomb: a set of instructions secretly incorporated into a program so that if a particular condition is satisfied they will be       carried out, usually with harmful effects.
  * Macro virus: A macro virus is a computer virus that "infects" a Microsoft Word or similar application and causes a sequence of           actions to be performed automatically when the application is started or something else triggers it. Macro viruses tend to be           surprising but relatively harmless.
  * port scan: A port scan is a series of messages sent by someone attempting to break into a computer to learn which computer network       services, each associated with a "well-known" port number, the computer provides. Port scanning, a favorite approach of computer         cracker, gives the assailant an idea where to probe for weaknesses.
  * tabjacking:Tabjacking is a new form of malware that can enter your PC through vulnerabilities in your Web browser that allow hackers     to insert malicious code into the tabs of your Web browser. The code is capable of hijacking the tab to a new Web page and inserting     advertising pop-ups, worms, trojans, or other malware into your PC.
  * ransomware: a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.
  * rootkit: A rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or areas of       its software that would not otherwise be allowed (for example, to an unauthorized user) and often masks its existence or the             existence of other software.
  * worm: A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. Often,     it uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. Unlike a computer         virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program.
  * zero day: A zero-day virus (also known as zero-day malware or next-generation malware) is a previously unknown computer virus or         other malware for which specific antivirus software signatures are not yet available. Traditionally, antivirus software relies upon     signatures to identify malware.
  * zombie: Image result for zombie virus define
    In computer science, a zombie is a computer connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, computer virus or           trojan horse program and can be used to perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction.
